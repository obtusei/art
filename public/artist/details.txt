name: samundra man singh shrestha
about: Born in 1980, Shrestha is a trained Paubha artist. He started his journey into the world of art at the tender age of 14.  Shrestha’s work skillfully combines his inspiration and mastery of the traditional Newar style of painting with conceptual contemporaneity—with binaries and juxtaposition of past and present, modern and traditional, and the aesthetic with pure conception. His innovative works push the boundaries of the sacred and secular, by challenging the very categories of contemporary and traditional art. His art works are deeply rooted in the sacred knowledge of iconography of deities, He has received significant national and international awards, and his work is in major collection of India, UK, US, Europe, and East Asia.

name: prem man chitrakar
about: Born in 1944, at Suichatar, Kathmandu, Chitrakar completed his Intermediate level in Humanities, and inherent his family occupation of painting, much against his father’s wish. However, he was well supported by his mother, who died early in his life and later by his wife. During his childhood, he would spend many days on the terrace of his house far from his father’s gaze, and practice drawing on the tin sheets. He believes that this ancient art form should be continued by the new generations following the texts of iconography and iconometry, yet exploring one’s own style. He worked as a Sikka Designer (designer of coins) at the Nepal Rasta Bank.
Besides painting, he has published many Newari language publications including Prarampara Chojya Bidhi and Nepal Bhasaya Mecha Dapa Khala Jhigu Sa. He was the former Chairman of Nepal Paramparagat Kalakar Sangh and Founder Adviser of the Artist’s Society.

name: raj prakash man tuladhar
about: Born in 1975, he was soon immersed in the local arts, thangkas, cultural themes and even traditional drum music. Raj Prakash never attended any formal college studies, but learnt his skills through some of the best teachers of paubha in Nepal. Prem Man Chitrakar was his main mentor, when he was just 16 years old. Until around 1987 (35 years ago) only the Chitrakar caste was allowed to teach the art of paubha painting. Now that has changed, and with those new ideas came the flourishing and diverse paubha art scene of today, where tradition and modernism meet in an amazing cacophony of colours and creative designs. 
 Raj Prakash has become well-known for his blend of striking figures and richly coloured paubha paintings, which adhere to the strict guidelines set for paubha, while also allowing the artist to put their unique signature style on the painting. His artworks were originally more attractive to foreign collectors, as the local audience was formerly less daring, but over the years the domestic art scene has seen an amazing growth and diversity. Today Raj Prakash seeks to bring Nepalese art to a wider clientele; this has become an over-riding passion, almost as great as his enthusiasm for his country’s traditional art.  
 He sells most of his work through galleries, collections and his connections abroad. He singles out the help he has had from Robert Beer in the UK, but today his art can be found as much in China as across the west. When requested Raj Prakash can produce paubha paintings for sacred and religious purposes, and in those cases he will stick rigidly to the centuries-old strict traditions that the artists must follow while painting. Although paubha is his overwhelming passion, he will experiment with any other art form like landscape or portrait, but this is normally on a commission or request basis. 
 Raj Prakash firmly believes today that “We should appreciate our children’s innate artistic desires and nurture them to follow their dreams.” He also intimates that before the Museum of Nepali Art (MoNA) was opened, much of his art was produced with a view to earning a living as well as for personal pleasure. He believes this museum has generated a greater awareness of the domestic art scene.

name: rabi shrestha
about: Rabi is from what was the small farming community of Tokha north of Kathmandu. His father was a carpenter in between toiling in the fields. He was born in 1990 before the urbanization of the valley really began, so he too experienced first-hand the life of a valley farmer. He recalls being fascinated by drawing as a child and it was his first passion at an early age. Having studied art first at Sirjana College followed by a BFA at Lalitkala Campus, he deliberately did not continue his formal studies to a Master’s degree. Having to study other forms of art (portrait, landscape etc) did not appeal at the time, as he already knew that paubha art was his true vocation.
Rabi was influenced by the three great artists of paubha in the valley: Udaya Charan Shrestha, Lok Chitrakar and Samundra Man Singh Shrestha, as well as his guru Ram Prakash Shrestha, who also trained and inspired other students and continues to do so. Rabi was extremely busy learning his skills – at college in the mornings, with his guru in the afternoons (painting and earning some cash from his works) and studying at home in the evenings – not forgetting time for his dal bhat! Rabi remembers this as the “learning and earning” training time. He is thankful that his family have always supported his endeavours, and as a successful artist their tolerance has been rewarded.
Like all proponents of the paubha art form, he too keeps very much to the ‘rules’ of the art and seeks to find acceptable ways in which to add his own style to the images – in the background and paint medium especially. He very much likes the freedom that being an artist can provide. He paints in poster colours, acrylic, oil and sometimes natural pigments. Rabi has an extraordinary ability to paint detailed and intricate paubha images at a very fast rate, something that surprises and amazes those who have a grasp of the art form – that though is the hallmark of an artist to find a niche in the field that is personally satisfying. He won a national award in 2018 for his Swayambhu Purana – Jyotirupa painting. 
As for the ‘nitty gritty’ of making a living, he has a Facebook page and relies on word of mouth for sales. Rabi has produced some superb paintings that range from absolute miniature to the almost impossibly large (impossible in that finding a canvas of quality and size was a major issue). One of his favourite subjects for painting is Ganesh – the miniature image at MoNA is as striking for its fine work and detail as it is for its dimensions. See it (and other works) in the MoNA Museum, but be sure to ask where to find it!

name: ritesh shahi
about: Born in 1989, Ritesh is already well on the road to becoming a significant artist in the painting circles of paubha. From a very early age Ritesh recalls being fascinated by the temple art in the Kathmandu Valley; he has retained a great passion for the art and culture of his home city ever since. In those early formative years, he would observe the temples and their art and then come home to draw the images seen.
After leaving school in 2005, he immediately began to embark on learning the art of paubha painting, although he has not been through formal education in the Fine Arts. Ritesh studied in Dallu under the experienced guidance of teacher Ram Prakash Shrestha; over four years he learnt his craft and is continuously developing his skills. Today he has his own studio, but he also works sometimes with Ram Prakash Shrestha. Like most paubha artists, he keeps very much to the traditions of the craft but he also likes to spread his more contemporary aspirations to paintings that illustrate his blossoming talents. He stresses the need to keep to traditional themes of paubha when working on most of his paintings, which take many patient hours to complete and finalise. Ritesh is attracted to his particular profession, as it offers the prospect of constantly learning and experiencing new themes and aspects of his art.
He also sees the benefit of being able to produce paintings that diverge from cultural norms, as this is a way to develop other strands of his art. This may be in the Fusion Style, but to find satisfaction and inspiration he is happy to work on completely different artistic themes. In fact he has produced some striking portrait images and uses other mediums other than colour for some paintings. Art is as much his hobby as it is his livelihood.
It is not always appreciated that making a living from art is a tenuous and at times difficult way of life. Fortunately interest in art is increasing in the country and particularly in the Kathmandu Valley, so the future for younger talents is bright.
He normally sells his art through local galleries and from word of mouth. Ritesh has also generously produced some Fusion Style works for charity – for the Kanti Children’s Hospital oncology department. Some of his major paintings can be viewed on the Museum of Nepali Art (MoNA) website and no one will be surprised by his contemporary take on a long-established art form.
