title: kurukulla
about: Kurukullā is a significant and famous form of Red Tārā. She is considered a Ḍākinī or yoginī who is an emanation of Amitābha Buddha. The goddess is regarded as a powerful enchantress who is a bewitcher of men. The main intention in her practice is not for the gain of material benefits regarded as corrupted, but for the development of Karuṇā, compassion. Kurukullā is also believed to be the offspring of Pancha Dhyāni Buddhas. 
Kurukullā’s iconography falls into two categories: one, following Mahayana iconographic traits, and second, following Tantric interpretation. Tibetan and Newar art mostly follow the Tantric variation. There is also the practice of conducting a homa ritual, observed as one of the important practices in the Vajrayāna tradition. This practice intends to cultivate bodhicitta used as a guide to realizing the truth of Voidness or śunyatā. Kurukullā destroys ignorance and transforms egocentric hindrances into energizing insight through her arrows of flowers. 
In this painting, Tuladhar has incorporated the Three Great Red Ones representing Kurukullā as the main deity, and at the bottom corners are the deities Rakta Gaṇeśa and Takkirāja. At the top can be found the Goddess of compassion, Ārya Tārā, a guru, and the Kurukullā yantra. The background is vibrant with vermilion color and the goddess is placed in front of the Nava Yoṇi yantra.

title: saptalochani
about: Saptalochani or The White Tara is a spectacular work of art. On first encounter with this masterpiece, a variety of emotions may emerge – from surprise to awe, bringing about an understanding that beauty has been totally redefined here. Saptalochani – a feeling engulfs you, as the beauty of simplicity captures the surrealist movement, it gently yet firmly overwhelms you. Your body, mind and soul enter a calm inner tidal wave. The flow of the energy resonates through the painting in a spiritual
manner, touching your inner self.
Saptalochani is not just a painting of the White Tara, but the artists’ lifetime learning essence captured in one single piece of canvas. Shrestha has mustered up his experiences and knowledge to bring out the mastery of simplicity. Through this style of simplicity, we view the incorporation of his linework, the rhythmic flow and blend of colors, and we witness the confident strokes of effortlessness and minimalism as they unite both the artist and the viewer.
The White Tara proclaims a new era of Shrestha’s work. To create art, share, and then let it go; that’s one of the keys to living a successful and peaceful life. This artwork reminds one to be humble, thankful and compassionate.
Tara is a symbol of love, compassion and beauty. Compassion is defined as being thoughtful towards the pain and sorrow of others. Shrestha’s Saptalochani helps us to be mindful through the simplicity, beauty, and attractiveness of his creation. The in-depth knowledge of White Tara becomes prominent not through the iconography but through the flow of the painter’s style and depiction.
There is always a perfect iconographic presentation of White Tara in paubhas, thangkas, statues and temples and monasteries. Yet, how do we transfer the knowledge of the past to the next generation with the same kind of intensity, emotions and faith? To be able to understand, respect and pass down the values while retaining the same core is what Shrestha has mastered.

title: hevajra mandala
about: Hevajra appears here in his three-headed and four-armed form. This manifestation is drawn from the Hevajra Tantra, a text revered by the Sakya order of Tibetan Buddhism, who likely commissioned this painting from a Newari artist from Nepal. Hevajra and his consort Nairatmya dance at the intersection of four vajra gateways, indicating their position at the center of the cosmos. His name is composed of two syllables: “he,” compassion, representing the male aspect, and “vajra,” wisdom, the female aspect, which together offer the path beyond this illusory world. The repeating skull symbolism references the impermanence of all phenomena. Beyond the celestial palace are the eight great charnel grounds, each presided over by a yogic master, or mahasiddha. On the reverse, in an ornate Tibetan lantsa script, are the Sanskrit mantra oh ah hum and mantra syllables configured in a stupa silhouette.

title: rato machhindranath temple
about: The Rato Machhendranath Temple stands about 400 meters south of Patan's (Lalitpur's) Darbar Square in a large courtyard known as Ta Baha. Built in 1673 on the foundations of older temples which existed here since the 15th century, the temple honors Machhendranath (also known as Matsyendra), an influential early 10th century yogi who credited the god Shiva as his teacher and who practiced in the Indic lands of the era. While Machhendranath was of the Hindu faith, over the centuries, his memory was revered by Hindus and Buddhists alike. In Nepal, in particular, he has come to be known as a god of rain among both faiths, with Buddhists seeing him as an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, and Hindus describing him as an incarnation of his old teacher, Shiva.

title: shiva vishvarupa
about: Shiva is one of Hinduism’s major gods and the supreme god of the Shaivite sect, worshipers devoted primarily to him. He takes many forms—ascetic, destroyer, conqueror of death, cosmic dancer—and this painting presents him as Vishvarupa, “universal form” or “form of the world.” In this painting the viewer has the sense that the deity takes up all available space on the canvas, a visual metaphor for the perception that the entire world is divine. He embraces his female consort, who is in complete harmony with the mustached male god; the two appear to almost blend into each other. Both have a multitude of heads and arms, indicating their infinite vision and reach. Shiva bears the orbs of the sun and moon in his two main hands, as if the cosmos itself were in his grasp. The couple dances atop a dais supported by lesser Hindu gods and within an aureole of fire. They are surrounded by scenes of charnel grounds and other manifestations of the great god. At the bottom center the couple is shown in sexual embrace but their colors are reversed.

title: rakta lokeshvara
about: Rakta, or Red, Lokeshvara, a meditation form of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion, stands at the center of this painting with his spiritual father Amitabha emanating from his crown and surrounded by a number of Hindu gods emanating from his body. In Nepal Buddhist deities and Hindu gods are both vital parts of ritual life and are worshiped side-by-side, and several deities particularly important to local communities retain conflated religious identities and are celebrated by Hindu and Buddhists alike at annual festivals and in daily rituals. In this case Red Lokeshvara has another identity as the local Hindu god Macchendranath, who is appealed to in a festival preceding the monsoon rains. Indeed, an inscription in gold letters below his feet identifies him as such (Macchendranath). A long inscription in Newari (a Nepalese script) at the center of the lower register emphasizes Lokeshvara’s kindness. It further indicates that the painting was commissioned in 1842 by a man named Shakya Bhikshu Bhavanisinha who lived in Kunche in the locality of Noghal (Kathmandu) together with his family. Below the inscription the artist has portrayed the family of donors on either side of Six-armed Mahakala. In this painting we see Newari painters employing artistic conventions of the nineteenth century with traditional elements such as those found in the donor depiction at the bottom.

title: siddha lakshmi
about: The fierce Siddha Lakshmi, a wrathful manifestation of the Hindu goddess Durga, was the protecting and guiding goddess of the Malla kings, who ruled Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley from the thirteenth through eighteenth century and their descendants. Here she is shown at the center of the composition standing on the hands of her consort, the great god Shiva, with her various forms occupying the registers above and below. Her name opens with the Sanskrit term “siddha” which indicates that she has mastered the art of accomplishment, and as such she is appealed to by followers for the successful completion of projects.
This painting’s tightly packed composition is characteristic of Nepalese paintings, which typically fill the canvas with deities, gods, goddesses, animals, and floral motifs. Also characteristic of Nepalese works of art, this painting includes an inscription on its back that allows it to be dated to 1796.
